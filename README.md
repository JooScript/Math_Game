# Simple Math Game (C++ Console Application)

## Overview
The **Simple Math Game** is a console-based application developed in C++ that generates random arithmetic questions and tracks the player's score based on correct answers. The game follows the **Separation of Concerns (SoC)** principle, ensuring a clean and maintainable code structure.

## Features
✔ **Modular Design** – The game is divided into logically separated functions for:
   - Question generation
   - User input handling
   - Score calculation
   - Game flow control  

✔ **Randomized Math Problems** – Dynamically generates arithmetic questions (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) with varying difficulty.  
✔ **Score Tracking** – Maintains and displays the player's score in real-time.  
✔ **User-Friendly Interface** – Simple console menu with clear instructions.  
✔ **Error Handling** – Validates user input to prevent crashes.  

## Technical Details
- **C++ Functions & Procedural Programming** – Ensures clean and reusable code.
- **Separation of Concerns (SoC)** – Logic divided into distinct functions for better maintainability.
- **rand() & srand()** – Used for generating random numbers for questions.
- **Loops & Conditional Statements** – Efficiently control game flow and decision-making.

## How to Run the Game
### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler (e.g., **GCC**, **MSVC**, or **Clang**)
- A terminal or command prompt

## Usage Instructions
1. The game presents random arithmetic questions.
2. Enter your answer when prompted.
3. The game checks the answer and updates your score accordingly.
4. You can continue answering or exit the game at any time.
5. The final score is displayed at the end of the game.

## Why This Project?
This project showcases:
- Writing structured and efficient C++ code.
- Applying software design principles (**Separation of Concerns**).
- Handling user input and creating interactive console applications.

## Future Enhancements
- Adding a timer for each question.
- Storing high scores using file handling.

## License
This project is open-source and free to use under the **MIT License**.
